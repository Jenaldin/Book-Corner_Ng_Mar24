      <p class="p-text">First things first, thank you for visiting the App and the About page. As The Book Corner is a
         student project, I would assume you are either one of my fellow students or one ouf our instructors. In both
         cases, hello!
      </p>
      <p class="p-text">If you are not a person from my classes, but a curious fella (or lady) hello to you too and I
         am happy The Book Corner caught your eye!
         Please be aware that this is an Angular App developed by me for my Angular course exam. I will not make
         excuses, but just know it is beginner level and I do understand there is more to be required, but hey, Netflix,
         Google, Microsoft, Nintendo (and Rome) were not build in a month.
      </p>
      <p class="p-text">That said, this App is not for commercial use and it is not intended to be deployed. It is meant
         only to be used as project work for my exam. If you are the one examining me, I hope the experience was good enough.</p>
      <p class="p-text">The idea for The Book Corner comes from my love of books, reading and traveling the world(s)
         fueled by my imagination without even going outside. I would personally enjoy such an App and using it. If
         you'd like to share something with me, reach out via one of the social links posted here. Who knows, this could become a passion project for me and a real App someday!
