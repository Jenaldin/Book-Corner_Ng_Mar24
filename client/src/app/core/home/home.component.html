         willing to share and also pick a book or two from our users' libraries to read. Per mutual agreement, the books
         are lent for a 3-month period, but
         depending on their length, you could contact the Book Owner via e-mail to extend that time.</p>
      <p class="p-text">Below you can find the latest 5 additions to our library. We hope to pique your interest and for
         you to become
