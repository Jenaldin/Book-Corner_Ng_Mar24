      <p class="p-text">We do not take money, as we do this as a way to get know our neighbors better and build a
         stronger community, with
         the bonus of meeting likeminded people and enjoying new books and worlds to explore.</p>
      <p class="p-text">You are free to explore our Book Catalog and take a look around, but if you want to join us,
         please Register.
         This way you will be able to share which parts of your home library you are willing to share and also pick a
         book or two from the other users to read. Per mutual agreement, the books are lent for a 3-month period, but
         depending on their length, you could contact the Book Owner via e-mail to extend that time.</p>
      <p class="p-text">Below you can find the latest 5 additions to our library. We hope to pique your interest and for
         you to become
         a part of the community. Enjoy!</p>
